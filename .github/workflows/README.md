# GitHub Actions Workflows

This directory contains CI/CD workflows for the Proxy Load Balancer project.

## Workflows

### 1. Test Workflow (`test.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main` branch

**What it does:**
- Sets up Java 21 with Maven
- Compiles the project
- Runs the integration test suite
- Uploads test results as artifacts

**Status Badge:**

```

### 2. Release Workflow (`release.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` branch
- Push of version tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`)

**What it does:**
- Builds native binaries for multiple architectures:
  - **Linux AMD64** (x86_64) - Most common 64-bit systems
  - **Linux ARM64** (aarch64) - Raspberry Pi 4/5, ARM servers, Apple Silicon via Rosetta
  - **Linux x86** (i686) - 32-bit x86 systems
- Creates SHA256 checksums for each binary
- Generates release notes
- Creates a **draft release** on GitHub with all binaries

**Architecture Support:**

| Architecture | Runner | Use Case |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| AMD64 (x86_64) | `ubuntu-latest` | Standard Linux servers, desktops |
| ARM64 (aarch64) | `ubuntu-latest-arm64` | Raspberry Pi, ARM servers, cloud ARM instances |
| x86 (i686) | `ubuntu-latest` (cross-compile) | Legacy 32-bit systems |

**Note:** The release is created as a **draft**, allowing you to:
1. Review the binaries
2. Edit release notes
3. Test the binaries
4. Publish when ready

## Setup Requirements

### For ARM64 Builds

GitHub Actions requires ARM64 runners. You have two options:

1. **GitHub-hosted ARM64 runners** (if available for your plan)
2. **Self-hosted ARM64 runner**

To use self-hosted runners, modify the `release.yml`:

```yaml
- os: linux
  arch: arm64
  runner: [self-hosted, linux, arm64]  # Use your self-hosted runner
  artifact_name: proxy-balancer-linux-arm64
```

### For x86 (32-bit) Builds

The workflow uses cross-compilation with musl libc for x86 builds. This requires:
- GraalVM with native-image
- musl-tools for static linking

If x86 builds fail, you can:
1. Remove the x86 entry from the matrix
2. Use a self-hosted x86 runner
3. Use Docker-based cross-compilation

## Customization

### Changing Build Targets

Edit the `matrix` section in `release.yml`:

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    include:
      # Add or remove architectures here
      - os: linux
        arch: amd64
        runner: ubuntu-latest
        artifact_name: proxy-balancer-linux-amd64
```

### Adding macOS/Windows Builds

Add to the matrix:

```yaml
# macOS ARM64 (Apple Silicon)
- os: macos
  arch: arm64
  runner: macos-14
  artifact_name: proxy-balancer-macos-arm64

# macOS AMD64 (Intel)
- os: macos
  arch: amd64
  runner: macos-13
  artifact_name: proxy-balancer-macos-amd64

# Windows AMD64
- os: windows
  arch: amd64
  runner: windows-latest
  artifact_name: proxy-balancer-windows-amd64.exe
```

### Automatic Release Publishing

To automatically publish releases (instead of drafts), change in `release.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Create Draft Release
  uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
  with:
    draft: false  # Change from true to false
```

### Version Tagging

The workflow automatically generates version tags based on:
- Maven project version from `pom.xml`
- Timestamp for uniqueness

To use Git tags instead:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'  # Trigger on version tags like v1.0.0
```

Then create releases with:
```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

## Secrets Required

The workflows use `GITHUB_TOKEN` which is automatically provided by GitHub Actions. No additional secrets are needed.

## Troubleshooting

### ARM64 Build Fails

**Error:** `No runner matching the specified labels`

**Solution:** Either:
1. Use GitHub's ARM64 runners (if available)
2. Set up a self-hosted ARM64 runner
3. Remove ARM64 from the build matrix

### x86 Build Fails

**Error:** `native-image build failed`

**Solution:** 
1. The x86 build uses cross-compilation which may not work in all cases
2. Consider removing x86 from the matrix if not needed
3. Or use a dedicated x86 runner

### Native Image Build Fails

**Error:** `Out of memory` or `Build timeout`

**Solution:** Add to the build step:
```yaml
- name: Build native image
  run: |
    mvn -Pnative native:compile -DskipTests \
      -Dgraalvm.native-image.buildArgs="-J-Xmx4g"
```

## Testing Locally

Test the native build locally before pushing:

```bash
# Install GraalVM 21
sdk install java 21-graalvm

# Build native image
mvn clean package -Pnative -DskipTests

# Test the binary
./target/proxy-balancer --version
```
